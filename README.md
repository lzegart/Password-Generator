# Password-Generator

This password generator allows the user to select if they want, uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numberic characters, special characters, and emojis in their password criteria through prompts.
Then, it confirms user input.
Once confirmed, it pushes all variable options into an empty password array to then determine a randomized password. 
This password is then displayed on the web page in the text box.
